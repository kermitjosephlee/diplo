# Diplo JS

## a Diplomacy Clone

Based on the classic board game [Diplomacy](<"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game)">)

I got hooked on this game back in my university days. I'm not sure if it made me any friends but it definitely tested the ones I had and I'm all the better for it.

The SVG map was borrowed from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Diplomacy.svg) with so much gratitude. It kept me from having to figure out how to graphically represent the board after each move. So thank you very much Martin Asal & Wiki Commons.

Still a WIP.

Ultimately, this will be a node server on some sort of db (probably Postgres) to keep track of the orders and adjudicate the movements. Might have a snazzy React front-end for issuing orders, showing current and previous map states, and most likely a websockets chat feature.

Thought of using this as a way to plug into Slack and/or Discord to have daily order issuings and current chats.
